Study Buddy Matchmaking Program, connects students based on shared courses, interests, compatible study styles, similar 
grade averages, and availability. 
 
This program simplifies the process of finding suitable study partners and creating study groups by automating
the matchmaking process based on user profiles. It takes the information profile provided by the 
user, and compare it to a list of other profiles. It then returns compatible student profiles back to the user 
based on a percentage of best compatibility. The program analyzes the availability of two matched
users and determines possible meeting times. The program wis able to set a reminder for students to take a 
break after a period of time, and provides a random study tip for the user if desired.

The program cannot engage in real-time messaging and does not use advanced machine-learning algorithms for matching.
